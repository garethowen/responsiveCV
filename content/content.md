# Summary

I have worked continuously in professional software development since graduating with a first class degree in Mathematics with computation in 1998. I have held various roles including technical lead, architect, developer, agile leader and scrum master. 
I have expert experience with introducing and coaching modern development practices in agile teams, some examples being
TDD, mob programing, continuous integration, DIY usability testing.
In recent years I have spent most of my time in senior development positions, and have conducted thousands of design and code reviews.
I prefer to stay close to the developers and the code base, so I can feel the pain first hand in order to steer the team towards
continuous improvements.
