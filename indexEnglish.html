			<h2>Summary</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="sectionContent">
			<p>I have worked continuously in professional software development since graduating with a <strong>first class degree in Mathematics with Computation</strong> in 1998. Roles I have held include <strong>technical lead</strong> and <strong>senior software architect</strong>, <strong>agile leader</strong> and <strong>scrum master</strong>.</p>
			<p>I am an expert at introducing and coaching modern development practices in agile teams. I am a very visual person and love working out designs with other team members on a whiteboard before anyone takes to the keyboard.</p>
			<p>Most recently I have specialized in developing <strong>Web Applications</strong> with backends running on <strong>.NET</strong> and <strong>Java</strong>, and rich clients built with <strong>HTML5</strong> and <strong>Vaadin</strong>. But previously I have built desktop applications for Windows and Mac, server applications running on Unix - even video games for the Sony Playstation.</p>
			<p>I am eager for a position working in an agile environment, within a team empowered to develop great products with latest technologies - resilient backends running on cloud infrastructure; front ends delivering the best user experience. I need the chance to learn new technologies and practices - to push myself out of the comfort zone once more and continue my personal development.</p>
			<p>I grew up in England but moved to Germany in 1999. My British passport allows me to work in the EU, and to cover any potential Brexit problems I have applied for German citizenship. I am married with two children and have been living in Haan since 2004.</p>

					<span>Senior Software Developer, </span>
					<span>Agile Leader</span>
				</h2>
				<h3><a href="https://www.qiagen.com/" target="_black">QIAGEN GmbH</a>, Hilden (Biotechnology)</h3>
				<h4>December 2016 till present</h4>
				<p>I worked on a <strong>java web application</strong> which managed the workflow of molecular diagnostic tests in a laboratory and interfaced with many external systems and instruments. I had the roles of <strong>technical lead<strong> and </strong>agile lead</strong>.</p>
				<p>The software was initially developed by an external software house, who chose to use the <strong>Vaadin</strong> framework. When I started at QIAGEN the decision was made to internalise further development of the product, so we inherited the code base. The internal team grew to over 20 members, split into <strong>multiple scrum teams</strong>.</p>
				<p>As technical lead I was involved in the <strong>hiring and training</strong> process of many developers, as well as leading one of the scrum teams. I used my deep understanding of the architecture to guide development decisions.</p>
				<p>As agile lead I drove the changes required to achieve effective team structures over multiple sites as the project evolved. I regularly led retrospectives on multiple levels.</p>
				<p>I was the <strong>leader of QIAGEN's agile community of practice</strong>. Together we planed, organised and moderated events to improve agile understanding and drive improvements across departments, projects and sites. I coached many scrum masters and introduced new practices such as Mob Programming, Lean Coffee and DIY usability testing. At department level I also served as a <strong>change agent</strong> and was a member of the <strong>software strategy team</strong>.</p>

					<span>Senior Software Architect, </span>
					<span>Scrum Master</span>
				</h2>
				<h3><a href="https://www.longview.com/" target="_blank">Longview Europe GmbH</a>, Langenfeld (Business Intelligence)</h3>
				<h4>September 2007 till December 2016</h4>
				<p>Initially employed as software developer, I was promoted to a <strong>senior software architect</strong> role after two years.
				</p>
				<p>One of my main responsibilities was as architect in the scrum team building the collaborative <strong>Business Intelligence</strong> product, arcplan Engage - a web application built using ASP.NET and a <strong>responsive HTML5 client</strong>. I oversaw the design of front and back end, coordinating with other scrum teams that built the software systems we integrated with.</p>
				<p>
				<p>Our team also took over the migration of legacy .NET and Java clients to HTML5. I was the architect of this <strong>client redesign</strong> project. After analysing the current status of the HTML5 client, we chose to focus the redesign around making a clearer separation of the HTML5 components from the rest of the client code. The resulting HTML5 components were reusable and independently testable. Performance increased tenfold - we measured every night - and maintainability immeasurably.</p>
				I was regarded as the <strong>expert in automated testing</strong>, and drove the development of the <strong>Continuous Integration</strong> processes, consisting of pre-commit stages using TFS Gated Checkin Builds, and post-checkin stages using Jenkins to automate unit tests (JavaScript/Jasmine, c#), Functional tests (with FitNesse), front-end tests (using casper, phantomJS, phantomCSS), code metrics (with powershell and c#) and performance tests (using powershell and javascript/phantomJS).</p>
				<p>
				I was awarded the <strong>Most Valuable Player</strong> award at Longview in 2014 for my work in this area.</p>

				<h3><a href="http://www.ragtime.de/start.html" target="_blank">Ragtime GmbH</a>, Hilden (Business Publishing)</h3>
				<h4>October 1999 till August 2007</h4>
				<p>
				Development of the RagTime Business Publishing software, running on Mac and Windows. RagTime is a cross between DTP and Office software, using frame based layout to present text, spreadsheets, charts and images. Written in C++.</p>
				<p>
					Projects I worked on included:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Text processing module.</strong> At the heart of this module was a layout algorithm based upon TeX, but extended for features such as packing textual and non-textual content into irregular containers, and using multiple columns. We relied heavily on background threads and caching to keep the algorithm fast enough to achieve a live-rebreak of text as the container size changed.</li>
					<li><strong>2D Graphics module.</strong> We abstracted the graphical systems (GDI+, Quartz, PostScript) with a common interface that could be used by other modules throughout the code base. We implemented functionality that was not offered natively on any particular platform - for example hit testing was missing in early versions of Quartz on MacOSX, so I wrote routines to flatten paths into polylines and check distance from a mouse position.</li>
					<li><strong>Text-on-a-path feature.</strong> Dynamic algorithm to position Text on any 2D path, using other RagTime modules (Text and Graphics)</li>
					<li><strong>Bitmap processing module.</strong> Stream based engine to convert bitmaps into different formats.</li>
					<li><strong>Spell checking module.</strong> A service offering spell checking in a background thread. A plugin architecture was used to inject spell checking implementations either from the OS or by a third party library.</li>
					<li><strong>PostScript export.</strong> Export a RagTime document to PostScript format for printing or conversion into PDF.</li>
					<li><strong>HTML export.</strong> Export a RagTime document into an HTML, using many nasty tricks to preserve layout.</li>
				</ul>
