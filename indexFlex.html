			<h2>Summary</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="sectionContent">
			<p>I have worked continuously in professional software development since graduating with a first class degree in Mathematics with Computation in 1998. Roles I have held include technical lead and senior software architect; agile leader and scrum master.</p>
			<p>I am an expert at introducing and coaching modern development practices in agile teams. I am a very visual person and love working out designs with other team members on a whiteboard before anyone takes to the keyboard.</p>
			<p>Most recently I have specialized in developing Web Applications with backends running on .NET and Java, and rich clients built with HTML5 and Vaadin. But previously I have built desktop applications for Windows and Mac, server applications running on Unix - even video games for the Sony Playstation.</p>
			<p>I am eager for a position working in an agile environment, for a team empowered to develop great products with latest technologies - resilient backends running on cloud infrastructure; front ends delivering the best user experience.</p>

				<h2>
					<span>Senior Software Developer, </span>
					<span>Agile Leader</span>
				</h2>
				<h3>QIAGEN GmbH, Hilden (Biotechnology)</h3>
				<h4>December 2016 till present</h4>
				<p>I worked on a complex java web application which interfaced with many external systems as technical and agile lead. The software was initially developed by an external software house, who chose to use the Vaadin framework. I started at QIAGEN when they decided to internalise further development of the product to save costs. The team grew to over 20 members, split into multiple scrum teams. As technical lead I was involved in the hiring and training process of many developers, as well as leading one of the scrum teams. As agile lead I drove the changes required to achieve effective team structures over multiple sites as the project evolved.</p>
				<p>I was the leader of QIAGEN's agile community of practice. Together we planed, organised and moderated events to improve agile understanding and drive improvements across departments, projects and sites. I trained many scrum masters and introduced new practices such as Mob Programming, LeanCoffee and DIY usability testing. At department level I also served as a change agent and was a member of the software strategy team.</p>

					<span>Senior Software Architect, </span>
					<span>Scrum Master</span>
				</h2>
				<h3>Longview Europe GmbH, Langenfeld (Business Intelligence)</h3>
				<h4>September 2007 till December 2016</h4>
				<p>Initially employed as software developer, I was quickly invited to take the role of architect. 
				</p>
				<p>One of my main responsibilities was as technical lead of the scrum team building the collaborative Business Intelligence product, arcplan Engage - a web application built using ASP.NET and a responsive HTML5 client. I oversaw the design of front and back end, coordinating with other scrum teams that built the software systems we integrated with.</p>
				<p>
				I was regarded as the expert in automated testing, and drove the development of the Continuous Integration processes, consisting of pre-commit stages using TFS Gated Checkin Builds, and post-checkin stages using Jenkins to automate unit tests (JavaScript/Jasmine, c#), Functional tests (with FitNesse), front-end tests (using casper, phantomJS, phantomCSS), code metrics (with powershell and c#) and performance tests (using powershell and javascript/phantomJS).</p>
				<p>
				I was awarded the 'Most Valuable Player' award at Longview in 2014 for my work in this area.</p>

				<h2>
					<span>Software Engineer</span>
				</h2>
				<h3>Ragtime GmbH, Hilden (Business Publishing)</h3>
				<h4>October 1999 till August 2007</h4>
				<p>
				Development of the RagTime Business Publishing software, running on Mac and Windows. RagTime is a cross between DTP and Office software, using frame based layout to present text, spreadsheets, charts and images. Written in C++.</p>
				<p>
					Projects I worked on included:
					</p>
					<ul class="jobDetailList">
					<li><b>Text processing module.</b> At the heart of this module was a layout algorithm based upon TeX, but extended for features such as packing textual and non-textual content into irregular containers, and using multiple columns. We relied heavily on background threads and caching to keep the algorithm fast enough to achieve a live-rebreak of text as the container size changed.</li>
					<li><b>2D Graphics module.</b> We abstracted the graphical systems (GDI+, Quartz, PostScript) with a common interface that could be used by other modules throughout the code base. We implemented functionality that was not offered natively on any particular platform - for example hit testing was missing in early versions of Quartz on MacOSX, so I wrote routines to flatten paths into polylines and check distance from a mouse position.</li>
					<li><b>Text-on-a-path feature.</b> Dynamic algorithm to position Text on any 2D path, using other RagTime modules (Text and Graphics)</li>
					<li><b>Bitmap processing module.</b> Stream based engine to convert bitmaps into different formats.</li>
					<li><b>Spell checking module.</b> A service offering spell checking in a background thread. A plugin architecture was used to inject spell checking implementations either from the OS or by a third party library.</li>
					<li><b>PostScript export.</b> Export a RagTime document to PostScript format for printing or conversion into PDF.</li>
					<li><b>HTML export.</b> Export a RagTime document into an HTML, using many nasty tricks to preserve layout.</li>
					</ul>
