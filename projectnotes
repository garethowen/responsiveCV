	- three media queries?
	- translation
		with data binding?
	- main area

		- interests

source format options:

- json
- markdown
- xml
- custom

destimation formats:

- html + css
- pdf

tools:
- wkhtmltopdf https://wkhtmltopdf.org/	


difficulties:
- getting PDF page layout/breaks correct
- some formatting may not work

so...separate documents...

decision:
	- responsive cv in html+css
	- online sites just point to this, for latest info
	- do a pdf separately
