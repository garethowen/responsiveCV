check all inline profiles link to the responsiveCV
	- xing
	- linkedin
	- gitHub
	- stack overflow

- no background in small widths!!!
- no background for print view!!!

set up difftool and merge tool...again!!!

scan and upload certificates/references
	add to git too?

responsiveCV should have section to link to certificates/references

upload my profile to:

	haan-coding-club/responsiveCV

upload project to gitHub

print media query:
	skills highlights not styled...? huh?
	certificates/reference section removed
	make sure width is chosen for best print result (with picture)

	- header
		- done?
	- three media queries?
	- translation
		with data binding?
	- main area
		- summary
		- skills
		- work experience
		- education
		- interests

source format options:

- json
- markdown
- xml
- custom

destimation formats:

- html + css
- pdf

tools:
- wkhtmltopdf https://wkhtmltopdf.org/	


difficulties:
- getting PDF page layout/breaks correct
- some formatting may not work

so...separate documents...

decision:
	- responsive cv in html+css
	- online sites just point to this, for latest info
	- do a pdf separately
